# **Eye Tracking with Face Distance Finder Program**

### **Overview**
The Eye Tracking with Face Distance Finder program uses Python and computer vision libraries like OpenCV and `cvzone` to detect a face in a live video stream from a webcam. It calculates the distance from the camera to the face by utilizing the focal length and object width concept. This allows for real-time face tracking and distance measurement, making it useful for applications like user interaction and eye monitoring.

### **Key Features**
- **Face Detection**: Detects and tracks faces in real-time from the webcam feed.
- **Eye Position Tracking**: Identifies and marks the positions of the eyes.
- **Distance Measurement**: Calculates the distance from the camera to the detected face using the known width of the face and the focal length.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides immediate visual feedback, displaying the face distance and eye positions on the webcam stream.
- **Camera Flexibility**: Works with any camera supported by OpenCV.
