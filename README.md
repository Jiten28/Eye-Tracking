# Eye Tracking
 Eye Tracking with face distance finder program.
 
 The Python script uses OpenCV and the cvzone library to detect a face in a live video stream from a webcam. It calculates the distance from the camera to the face using the concept of focal length and object width.
 
 It uses:
   • cv2 (OpenCV): For image and video processing.
   • cvzone: A library that provides various computer vision utilities, including FaceMeshDetector used for detecting facial landmarks.
