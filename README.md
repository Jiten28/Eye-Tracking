# **Eye Tracking with Face Distance Finder Program**

### **Overview**
The Eye Tracking with Face Distance Finder program uses Python and computer vision libraries like OpenCV and `cvzone` to detect a face in a live video stream from a webcam. It calculates the distance from the camera to the face by utilizing the focal length and object width concept. This allows for real-time face tracking and distance measurement, making it useful for applications like user interaction and eye monitoring.
